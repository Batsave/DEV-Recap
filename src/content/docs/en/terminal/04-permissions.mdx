## Linux Permissions

Each file/directory has permissions: **read (r), write (w), execute (x)**.  
They apply to:  
- **u** → user (owner)  
- **g** → group  
- **o** → others  

---

## Changing Permissions

```bash
chmod 755 script.sh
chmod u+x file.sh
```

➡ `755` = user: rwx, group and others: rx

---

## Changing Ownership

```bash
chown user:user file.txt
```

---

## Running as Administrator

```bash
sudo apt update
```

---

## Best Practices

- Check permissions with `ls -l`.  
- Only use `777` as a last resort.  
- Use `sudo` only when necessary.
