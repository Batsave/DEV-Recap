## Creating a File

`touch` creates an empty file.  
If the file already exists, it updates its modification timestamp.

```bash
touch file.txt
```

---

## Creating a Directory

```bash
mkdir project
mkdir -p folder1/folder2/folder3
```

---

## Deleting a File or Directory

- `rm file.txt` → delete a file  
- `rm -r folder` → delete a directory and its contents  
- `rm -rf folder` → force delete without confirmation ⚠️

---

## Copying a File or Directory

```bash
cp file.txt copy.txt
cp -r folder1 folder2
```

---

## Moving or Renaming a File

```bash
mv file.txt newname.txt
mv file.txt Documents/
```

## Best Practices

- Verify your location with `pwd` before running `rm -r`.  
- Use `rm -i` to prompt for confirmation.  
- Prefer `mkdir -p` to avoid errors.  
- Check results with `ls`.
