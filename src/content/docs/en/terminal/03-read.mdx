## Editing files

- `nano file.txt` → simple, intuitive editor.  
- `vim file.txt` → advanced, powerful editor with a steep learning curve.

## Best Practices

- Use `less` instead of `cat` for long files.  
- Use `tail -f` to monitor **logs in real time**.  
- Start with `nano` before diving into `vim`.
