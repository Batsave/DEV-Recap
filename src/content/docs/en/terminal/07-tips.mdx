## Handy Tips

- Use the ↑ and ↓ arrows to navigate command history.  
- `history` → list all past commands.  
- `!<number>` → rerun a command from history.  
- `alias update="sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade"` → create a shortcut.  
- Use **Tab** for auto-completion.  
- `clear` or `Ctrl + L` to clear the screen.

## Best Practices

- Use **aliases** to save time.  
- Learn some **keyboard shortcuts** (Ctrl + C, Ctrl + L).  
- Review history (`history`) to quickly re-execute commands.
