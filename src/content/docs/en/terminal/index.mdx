## What is the terminal?

The **terminal** (or command line) is a tool that allows you to control a computer **by typing text commands**.  
It is used by developers, system administrators, and power users because it is **fast, powerful, and automatable**.

## Why use the terminal?

- Quickly navigate files and directories.  
- Automate repetitive tasks via scripts.  
- Access remote servers.  
- Install and manage software.
