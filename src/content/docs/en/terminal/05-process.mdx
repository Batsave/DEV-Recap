## Practical Example

1. Run `top` to view activity.  
2. Identify the **PID** of a process.  
3. Use `kill <PID>` to terminate it.

## Best Practices

- Prefer a simple `kill` before using `kill -9`.  
- Use `htop` for easier process management.  
- Double-check the **PID** before killing a process.
