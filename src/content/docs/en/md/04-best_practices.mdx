## Organization

- Leave a **blank line** between blocks (headings, lists, blockquotes)  
- Maintain heading hierarchy (`#`, `##`, `###`)  
- Prefer lists over long paragraphs  

---

## Compatibility

- Some renderings (underline, table alignment) depend on the platform  
- Check rendering on GitHub, VS Code, Obsidian, etc.  
- For web use, always verify the generated HTML conversion

## Accessibility

- Provide **alt text** for images (`![alt](img.png)`)  
- Use clear, descriptive headings instead of abbreviations  
- Structure content logically to support assistive reading
