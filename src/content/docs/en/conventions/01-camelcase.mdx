## camelCase

**Example**: `userName`, `getUserAge`

### Why?
- Readable because each new word starts with an uppercase letter.
- Inspired by object-oriented languages like Java and C#.
- Adopted by JavaScript for **variables** and **functions**.

### Practical example

```js
let userName = "Alice";
function getUserAge() { return 25; }
```

Advantages: readable, compact.
Disadvantage: less readable for very long names.
