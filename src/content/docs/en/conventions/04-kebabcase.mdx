**Example**: `main-container`, `btn-primary`

### Why?
- Suitable for **CSS and HTML**, as classes and IDs cannot contain spaces.
- Highly readable within files.
- Also used for **file names**.

### Practical example

```html
<div class="main-container"></div>
```

```css
.main-container {
  padding: 20px;
}
```

Advantages: readable, web-friendly.
Disadvantage: cannot be used in JS (the `-` is interpreted as a subtraction operator).
