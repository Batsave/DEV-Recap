**Example**: `App.Utils.Math`

### Why?
- Organizes code within **large projects**.
- Avoids naming collisions.
- Very common in Java, C#, and even JS (before ES6 modules).

### Practical example

```js
const App = {
  Utils: {
    sum: (a, b) => a + b
  }
};

console.log(App.Utils.sum(2, 3));
```

Advantages: well-structured code.
Disadvantage: verbose, replaced in JS by `import/export`.
