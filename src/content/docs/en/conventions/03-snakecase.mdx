**Example**: `user_name`, `max_value`

### Why?
- Highly readable thanks to underscores.
- Inherited from early languages (C, Python).
- Commonly used in **databases** (PostgreSQL, MySQL) where case-insensitivity matters.

### Practical example

```python
user_name = "Alice"
max_value = 100
```

Advantages: clear, universal.
Disadvantage: verbose to type (`Shift` + `_`).
