- Choose the convention suitable for the **language and context**.
- Be **consistent** throughout the entire project.
- Avoid randomly mixing conventions.
- Prefer **explicit names**, even if long, over cryptic abbreviations.
- Document the chosen convention clearly in collaborative projects.

## Bad vs. Good Example

### Bad:
```css
button.41 { color: red; }
.div2 { margin: 20px; }
```

### Good :
```css
button.danger { color: red; }
.container { margin: 20px; }
```
