**Example**: `MAX_SIZE`, `API_KEY`

### Why?
- Clearly differentiates **constants** from modifiable variables.
- Inherited from the **C** language and adopted by most languages.

### Practical example

```js
const MAX_SIZE = 100;
const API_KEY = "123-456";
```

Advantages: instantly recognizable.
Disadvantage: reserved for constants â†’ if misused, it can lose meaning.
