## Heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)

There are **6 levels of headings** in HTML, from `<h1>` to `<h6>`.

- `<h1>` is used for the **main title** of the page
- `<h2>` for **subtitles**
- `<h3>` to `<h6>` for lower-level headings (subsections)

### Example:

```html
<!-- Main title -->
<h1>Learn HTML while having fun</h1>

<!-- Chapter -->
<h2>Chapter 1: Basic tags</h2>

<!-- Subsection -->
<h3>1.1 Different tags</h3>
```

### Rules to follow:

- **Only one `<h1>`** per page.
- **No skipping levels** (don’t jump from `<h1>` directly to `<h3>`).
- Use a **logical hierarchy** to improve SEO and accessibility (especially for screen readers).

## Practice example:

You can practice with this text about cats, structuring it with the correct tags:

```html
<h1>What are cats?</h1>
<p>
  <strong>Cats</strong> are members of the <em>feline</em> family,
  sharing many characteristics with their cousins: lions, tigers, and panthers.
</p>

<h2>What is the history of cats?</h2>

<h3>The first domestic cats</h3>
<p>
  Cats originated from Africa, Asia, and Europe, and were domesticated around 9,000 years ago...
</p>

<h3>The domestication of cats in Europe</h3>
<p>Cats were introduced to Europe in the Middle Ages...</p>

<h2>What are cats’ characteristics?</h2>
<p>
  They are <em>very flexible</em>, can jump up to five times their height,
  and run at <abbr title="kilometers">km</abbr>/<abbr title="hour">h</abbr>.
</p>
```

## Emphasizing text

### `<strong>` = importance (bold)

To mark a word as **important**.

```html
<strong>cats</strong>
```

### `<em>` = emphasis (italic)

To emphasize a word.

```html
<em>felines</em>
```

> [!INFO] Information  
> These tags are semantic, so they are accessible and good for SEO.

---

## Tags to avoid for styling

- `<b>` = bold
- `<i>` = italic
- `<u>` = underline

> [!CAUTION] Warning  
> These tags provide **no meaning** to the text. Use **CSS** instead to handle appearance (bold, italic, underline).

---

## Quotes

### Blockquote:

```html
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">
  Cats are members of the feline family...
</blockquote>
```

---

## Abbreviations

Use `<abbr>` to display an explanation on hover:

```html
<abbr title="kilometers">km</abbr> <abbr title="hours">h</abbr>
```

---

## Displaying code

To display code in an HTML page:

```html
<pre>
  <code>
&lt;h1&gt;Hello, world&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my website&lt;/p&gt;
  </code>
</pre>
```

> The `<pre></pre>` block preserves line breaks and spaces.  
> The `<code></code>` block indicates that it is code.  
> Special characters must be encoded:

- `&` → `&amp;`
- `<` → `&lt;`
- `>` → `&gt;`
- `"` → `&quot;`
