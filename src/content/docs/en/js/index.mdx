## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a **programming language** primarily used to make web pages **dynamic and interactive**.  
Unlike **HTML** (content structure) and **CSS** (styling and layout), JavaScript handles the **logic** and **behavior** of a page.

It can run:

- **In the browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to manipulate a web page.  
- **Outside the browser** with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to build servers, scripts, or desktop applications.

## A brief history

- **1995**: Created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in just 10 days.  
- Initially called **Mocha**, then **LiveScript**, and finally **JavaScript** (to capitalize on Java's popularity at the time).  
- Today, it is standardized by **ECMA International** under the official name **ECMAScript (ES)**.  
- The most widely used version today is **ES6+ (ECMAScript 2015 and later)**.

## Main roles

- Manipulating the **DOM** (HTML page content).  
- Responding to **events** (clicks, keyboard input, etc.).  
- Communicating with a server via **APIs** (AJAX, fetch, WebSockets).  
- Creating **animations and visual effects**.  
- Building **server-side** applications (e.g., with Node.js).  
- Developing **mobile and desktop** apps (e.g., with React Native, Electron).

## Simple example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1 id="title">Bonjour</h1>
    <button onclick="changeText()">Click me</button>

    <script>
      function changeText() {
        document.getElementById("title").innerText = "Hello, JavaScript!";
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
