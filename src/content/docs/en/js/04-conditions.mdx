## If / Else

The conditional structure allows code to be executed only if a condition is true.  
In English, it can be read as: **"If ... then ... else ..."**

```js
let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("Adult");
} else {
  console.log("Minor");
}
```

> Here, if the variable age is greater than or equal to 18, it prints "Adult".  
Otherwise, it prints "Minor".

---

## Else If

`else if` allows testing multiple conditions in sequence.  
The program stops as soon as one condition is true.

```js
let grade = 15;

if (grade >= 16) {
  console.log("Excellent");
} else if (grade >= 10) {
  console.log("Average");
} else {
  console.log("Fail");
}
```

> If the grade is 15:  
> - The 1st condition (grade >= 16) is false  
> - The 2nd condition (grade >= 10) is true â†’ it prints "Average".  
> - The last one is not evaluated.

---

## Switch

`switch` is an alternative to multiple if/else if statements, more readable when comparing a single variable against multiple possible values.

```js
let day = "Tuesday";

switch (day) {
  case "Monday":
    console.log("Start of the week");
    break;
  case "Friday":
    console.log("Almost the weekend");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Regular day");
}
```

> [!CAUTION] Warning  
> Without `break`, execution continues into the following cases (fallthrough effect).  
> The `default` block runs if no case matches.

---

## Quick comparison

- If / Else: ideal for testing complex conditions (age > 18 && license === true).  
- Switch: more readable when testing one variable against several fixed values (day === "Monday", day === "Tuesday", etc.).

## Practical example

```js
let role = "admin";

if (role === "admin") {
  console.log("Full access");
} else if (role === "editor") {
  console.log("Limited access: editing allowed");
} else {
  console.log("Restricted access: read only");
}
```
