## What is a function?

A function is a **reusable block of code** that performs a specific task.  
It is called to **avoid repeating code** and improve readability.

In plain English:  
➡ **“Give a name to a set of instructions, and reuse them whenever you want.”**

---

## Function declaration

```js
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello " + name;
}

console.log(greet("Alice")); // Hello Alice
```

> Here, `greet` is a **declared function**.  
It can be called **before its definition** thanks to the hoisting mechanism.

---

## Function expressions

You can also store a function in a variable.  
In this case, it **cannot be called before its definition**.

```js
const greet = function(name) {
  return "Hi " + name;
};

console.log(greet("Bob")); // Hi Bob
```

---

## Arrow functions

Introduced with ES6, they offer a shorter syntax.  
They automatically inherit the `this` of their context *(lexical this)*, which makes them convenient in callbacks.

```js
const greet = (name) => "Hello " + name;

console.log(greet("Bob")); // Hello Bob
```

> Important difference:  
> - A classic function defines its own `this`.  
> - An arrow function uses the `this` of the context where it was defined.

---

## Parameters and default values

Parameters can have a default value if no argument is provided.

```js
function multiply(a, b = 2) {
  return a * b;
}

console.log(multiply(5));    // 10
console.log(multiply(5, 3)); // 15
```

---

## Returning a value

A function can return a result with `return`.

```js
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

let result = add(4, 6);
console.log(result); // 10
```

## Syntax comparison

| Syntax        | Example                     | Particularity |
|---------------|-----------------------------|---------------|
| Declaration   | ```function name() {}```    | Hoisting (can be called before definition) |
| Expression    | ```const f = function() {}``` | No hoisting |
| Arrow (ES6)   | ```const f = () => {}```    | Short syntax, lexical `this` |

> [!NOTE] Tip  
> If your wiki still renders double backticks incorrectly, you can escape braces with `{` and `}` to force their display.
