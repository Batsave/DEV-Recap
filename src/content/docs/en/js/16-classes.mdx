## What is a class?

A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects that share the same properties and methods.  
Under the hood, JavaScript classes are **syntactic sugar** over the **prototype-based** inheritance system.  

➡ They make code more readable and familiar to object-oriented programmers.

## Declaring a class

A class can contain:  
- a **constructor** → a special function executed when creating the object,  
- **methods** → functions defined within the class.  

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  introduce() {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

let alice = new Person("Alice", 25);
alice.introduce(); // My name is Alice and I am 25 years old.
```

---

## Inheritance

Using `extends`, a class can inherit from another.  
Use `super()` to call the parent class's constructor.

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name); // calls Animal constructor
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
  }
}

let rex = new Dog("Rex", "German Shepherd");
rex.speak(); // Rex barks.
```

---

## Static methods

A method can be declared `static` → it is called directly on the class, not on an instance.

```js
class Maths {
  static add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

console.log(Maths.add(2, 3)); // 5
```

---

## Best practices

- Use **classes** to model entities (e.g., `User`, `Product`).  
- Employ **`extends`** + **`super`** to reuse code and facilitate inheritance.  
- Prefer **static methods** when the action does not depend on a specific instance.  
- Keep in mind that **classes** are **syntactic sugar** → JavaScript still uses the **prototype** mechanism under the hood.
