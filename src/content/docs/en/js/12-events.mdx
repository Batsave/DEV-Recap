## What is an event?

An **event** is an action triggered by the user or the browser:  
mouse click, key press, page load, etc.

JavaScript lets you **respond** to these events by running code.

---

## Adding an event listener

The modern method is `addEventListener()`.  
It allows listening for an event and defining the function to execute.

```js
let button = document.getElementById("myButton");

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});
```

> Advantage: you can attach multiple listeners to the same element and remove them with `removeEventListener`.

---

## Common event types

- `click` → mouse click  
- `mouseover` → mouse hover  
- `keydown` → keyboard key pressed  
- `submit` → form submission  

---

## Using the `event` object

When an event fires, the callback function automatically receives an **`event` object**.  
This object contains **all the information** about the action that occurred.

Useful properties:  
- `event.type` → event type (`click`, `keydown`, etc.)  
- `event.target` → element that triggered the event  
- `event.key` → key pressed (keyboard events only)  
- `event.clientX` / `event.clientY` → click coordinates (mouse events)  

```js
document.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {
  console.log("Type:", event.type);      // "keydown"
  console.log("Key pressed:", event.key); // e.g. "a"
});
```

---
## Click example

```js
document.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  console.log("Element clicked:", event.target);
  console.log("Click position:", event.clientX, event.clientY);
});
```
> The `event` object is essential for making your code more responsive and precise.

---

## Practical example

```html
<input type="text" id="inputField" placeholder="Type something">
<p id="display"></p>

<script>
  let inputField = document.getElementById("inputField");
  let display = document.getElementById("display");

  inputField.addEventListener("input", () => {
    display.innerText = inputField.value;
  });
</script>
```
> Here, the paragraph updates in real-time as you type.

## Event propagation

By default, events go through two phases:

1. **Capturing** → the event travels from the **document** down to the target element in the DOM tree.  
2. **Bubbling** → after triggering, the event bubbles up from the **target element** to its ancestors.

This mechanism enables **event delegation**: handling events at a parent level instead of attaching listeners to each child individually.  
Very useful for lists or dynamically added elements.

---

## Best practices

- Use **`addEventListener`** instead of `onclick="..."` in HTML (cleaner and more flexible).  
- Always utilize the **`event` object** for useful information (`event.target`, `event.key`, etc.).  
- Remove unnecessary listeners with **`removeEventListener`** to avoid memory leaks.  
- Prefer **event delegation** (listen on a parent instead of each child) for better performance.
