## What is a Promise?

A **Promise** is an object representing an **asynchronous** operation (that takes time) and its future result.  
It can be in three states:

- `pending` → waiting (the promise has not settled yet)  
- `fulfilled` → successfully resolved (`resolve`)  
- `rejected` → failed (`reject`)  

➡ Instead of blocking the code, a Promise allows you to **wait for the result later**.

---

## Creating a Promise

```js
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let success = true;

  if (success) {
    resolve("Success");
  } else {
    reject("Error");
  }
});

promise
  .then(result => console.log(result))   // on success
  .catch(error => console.error(error))  // on error
  .finally(() => console.log("Promise settled")); // always executed
```

---

## Example with setTimeout

```js
function wait(ms) {
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}

wait(1000).then(() => console.log("1 second passed"));
```

---

## Concrete example: simulated request

```js
function getUser() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      let success = true;
      if (success) {
        resolve({ name: "Alice", age: 25 });
      } else {
        reject("Unable to fetch user");
      }
    }, 2000);
  });
}

getUser()
  .then(user => console.log("User:", user))
  .catch(err => console.error("Error:", err));
```

## Best practices

- Always handle errors with **`.catch()`** (or with `try/catch` if using `async/await`).  
- Use **`.finally()`** to run code **regardless of outcome** (success or error).  
- Prefer **`async/await`** for more readable and maintainable code when chaining promises.
