## What is asynchronous programming?

In JavaScript, code runs **line by line** (synchronously).  
But some operations (e.g., waiting a delay, loading an external resource, making an HTTP request) take time.

> Asynchronous programming allows you to **not block the program** during these operations.  
The rest of the code continues running, and the long task will be handled later when it’s ready.

## setTimeout

`setTimeout` runs a function **once** after a specified delay (in milliseconds).

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Executed after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
```

### Explanation (setTimeout)

- `console.log("Start")` → logs immediately  
- `setTimeout` is scheduled for **2000 ms (2s)**  
- `console.log("End")` runs **before** the `setTimeout` callback  
- After 2 seconds, the function inside `setTimeout` executes  

---

## setInterval

`setInterval` runs a function **repeatedly** at regular intervals.

```js
let count = 0;

let interval = setInterval(() => {
  count++;
  console.log("Count:", count);

  if (count >= 5) {
    clearInterval(interval); // stops the loop
  }
}, 1000);
```

### Explanation (setInterval)

- The function runs every **1000 ms (1 second)**  
- The counter increments on each run  
- When `count` reaches **5**, `clearInterval` stops the loop  

---

## When to use

- **setTimeout** → run a task **once after a delay**  
  _(e.g., show a notification after 5 seconds)_  
- **setInterval** → run a task **repeatedly**  
  _(e.g., update a clock in real time)_  

---

## Best practices

- Always clear an interval with **`clearInterval`** when it’s no longer needed (avoid infinite loops).  
- Avoid nesting too many `setTimeout` calls → prefer modern solutions like **Promises** or **async/await**.  
- Use asynchronous programming to keep an application **responsive** (do not block the UI).
