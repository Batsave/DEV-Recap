## Undo changes

```bash
git checkout -- file.txt   # discard uncommitted changes
```

## Undo the last commit

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1   # keep files staged
git reset --hard HEAD~1   # completely remove changes
```

## Roll back cleanly

```bash
git revert abc123
```

## Stash changes

```bash
git stash
git stash apply
```

## Best practices

- Use `git reset` only locally (dangerous if shared).  
- Prefer `git revert` to undo changes in a collaborative project.  
- Use `stash` to pause ongoing work.
