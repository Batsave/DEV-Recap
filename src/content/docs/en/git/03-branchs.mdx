## Create and list branches

```bash
git branch            # list branches
git branch new-branch # create a new branch
```

## Switch branches

```bash
git checkout new-branch
# or (new syntax)
git switch new-branch
```

## Merge a branch

```bash
git merge new-branch
```

---

## Best practices

- Use clear names (`feature/login`, `bugfix/header`).  
- Delete branches that are no longer needed with `git branch -d`.  
- Always test before merging.
