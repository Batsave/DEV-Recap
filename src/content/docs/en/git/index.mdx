## What is Git?

**Git** is a distributed version control system.  
It allows you to track file history, collaborate with others, and roll back to a previous state in case of error.  

➡ Unlike a simple backup, Git records each modification with a **commit**.

---

## Git vs GitHub

- **Git** = the tool installed locally, used to manage your repositories.  
- **GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket** = online platforms to host and collaborate on repositories.  

---

## Quick example

```bash
git init             # create a Git repository
git add .            # add all files
git commit -m "Init" # commit the files
```

## Best practices

- Always write **clear commit messages**.  
- Don’t confuse **Git (tool)** with **GitHub (platform)**.  
- Remember to use `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files.
