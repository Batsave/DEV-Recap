## General best practices

- Commit often, but only with coherent changes.  
- Use clear commit messages:  
  - Bad: "fix"  
  - Good: "Fix header display on mobile"  
- Always create a branch for a new feature.  
- Check `git status` and `git diff` before committing.  
- Use `.gitignore` to avoid versioning unnecessary files.
