## Add a remote repository

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/project.git
```

## Push commits

```bash
git push origin main
```

## Pull updates

```bash
git pull origin main
```

## Fetch without merging

```bash
git fetch
```

## Best practices

- Always pull (`git pull`) before pushing (`git push`).  
- Check `git remote -v` to list remote repositories.
