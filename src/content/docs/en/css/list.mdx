title: "Lists"
description: "CSS properties that define how to display <ul>, <ol>, <li> elements as well as definition lists (<dl>, <dt>, <dd>)."
sidebar:
  position: 1
---

These properties define the appearance of **lists** (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) as well as definition lists (`<dl>`, `<dt>`, `<dd>`).  
They mainly control bullets (or numbers), their position, their type, and the option to replace them with an image.

---

## Standard properties (to use)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `list-style` | Shorthand property combining `list-style-type`, `list-style-position`, and `list-style-image`. Can also remove bullets with `none`. |
| `list-style-type` | Defines the type of bullet or numbering (e.g., `disc`, `circle`, `square`, `decimal`, `lower-roman`, `none`). |
| `list-style-position` | Defines whether the bullet is displayed **inside** (`inside`) or **outside** (`outside`) the content block. |
| `list-style-image` | Defines an image as a custom bullet (`url(...)`). |

---

## Deprecated or specific properties

| Property | Status | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `marker-offset` | Deprecated | Defined the exact position of the bullet or number. Removed in CSS3, replaced by `list-style-position` and the `::marker` pseudo-element. |

---

## Simple example

```css
ul.custom {
  list-style-type: square;          /* Square bullets */
  list-style-position: inside;      /* Bullets inside the text */
}

ol.roman {
  list-style-type: upper-roman;     /* Roman numeral numbering */
}

ul.image {
  list-style-image: url("bullet.png"); /* Image as a custom bullet */
}

ul.none {
  list-style: none;                 /* Removes bullets */
}
```

## Key takeaways

- `list-style` lets you configure bullet type, position, and image in a single line.  
- `list-style-type` is the most commonly used to change the shape or remove bullets.  
- `list-style-image` allows graphic customization but is rarely used (prefer `::marker` or `::before`).  
- `marker-offset` is deprecated and replaced by `list-style-position` or the `::marker` pseudo-element.
