These properties apply only to `<table>` elements and their sub-elements (`caption`, `th`, `td`, etc.).  
They allow you to control the display, spacing, and layout of tables in CSS.

---

## Standard properties (to use)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `border-collapse` | Defines whether adjacent cell borders are separated (`separate`) or merged (`collapse`). |
| `border-spacing` | Defines the spacing between cell borders (only if `border-collapse: separate`). |
| `caption-side` | Defines the placement of the table caption (`top`, `bottom`). |
| `empty-cells` | Defines whether empty cells display their border (`show`) or not (`hide`). |
| `table-layout` | Defines how column widths are calculated: `auto` (default) or `fixed` (widths based on attributes/CSS values). |

---

## Specific / rarely used properties

| Property | Status | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `speak-header` | Deprecated (CSS2, accessibility) | Defined how table headers were read by screen readers. Today replaced by **ARIA** solutions and good HTML practices (`scope`, `headers`, etc.). |

---

## Simple example

```css
table {
  border-collapse: collapse; /* Merge borders */
  table-layout: fixed;       /* Fixed column widths */
  width: 100%;
}

td, th {
  border: 1px solid #333;
  padding: 8px;
}
```

## Key takeaways

- `border-collapse` and `border-spacing` control the appearance of cell borders.  
- `table-layout: fixed` is useful for fast-rendering tables with consistent column widths.  
- `caption-side` positions the caption above or below the table.  
- `empty-cells` can hide empty cells if needed.  
- `speak-header` is deprecated: use semantic HTML and ARIA for accessibility.
