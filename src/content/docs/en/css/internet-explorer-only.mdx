*The Mozilla/Firefox family represents more than 30% of browsers used worldwide. Be careful when using the following properties, as they were recognized only by Internet Explorer!*

## Obsolete properties (Internet Explorer only)

| Property | Status | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `behavior` | Obsolete | Allowed attaching a script or ActiveX component to an element. |
| `filter` (new style / old style) | Obsolete | Old IE syntax for applying graphical filters. Now replaced by the standard `filter` property. |
| `ime-mode` | Obsolete | Managed input for Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean). |
| `layout-flow` | Obsolete | Defined text flow in IE for Asian languages. |
| `layout-grid`, `layout-grid-char`, `layout-grid-line`, `layout-grid-mode`, `layout-grid-type` | Obsolete | Set of properties for character grid handling in IE (Asian languages). |
| `overflow-x`, `overflow-y` | Now standardized | First introduced in IE, now part of the CSS standard. |
| `scrollbar-*` (base-color, track-color, arrow-color, etc.) | Obsolete | Modified scrollbar colors in IE. Now replaced by `scrollbar-width`, `scrollbar-color`, and the `::-webkit-scrollbar` pseudo-elements. |
| `text-align-last` | Obsolete | Alignment of the last line of text. Only supported in IE. |
| `text-autospace` | Obsolete | Automatic character spacing for Asian languages. |
| `text-justify` | Obsolete | Text justification handling in IE. |

## Why it matters today

- These properties were **specific to Internet Explorer** and are **no longer recognized by modern browsers** (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Edge Chromium).  
- Some have been **integrated into the CSS standard** (e.g., `overflow-x/y`, `writing-mode`, `word-break`, `overflow-wrap`).  
- Others are **completely obsolete** (`scrollbar-*`, `behavior`, `ime-mode`) and should no longer be used.  
- Their usage can make your stylesheets **incompatible and hard to maintain**.

## Key takeaways

- Do not use these old IE properties, except for **legacy code**.  
- Prefer **modern standardized properties** (`filter`, `overflow-wrap`, `writing-mode`, modern `scrollbar-*`).  
- Keep in mind that IE has been officially **discontinued since 2022**: all current development should target modern browsers.
