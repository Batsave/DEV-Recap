_Before you start writing a CSS file, remember to reset your page with CSS using this code:_

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

a {
  text-decoration: underline; /* apply underline to links */
  text-decoration-thickness: 1px; /* make the underline thicker */
  text-underline-offset: 3px; /* shift the underline downward */
}

a:after {
  content: " â†—";
}
```

---

## Explanation

The `body` applies the code to the entire page.  
To avoid any default offset on your page, reset the `margin` and `padding` by setting them to `0`.  

The `text-decoration` property allows you to remove the default underline that distinguishes a link within text.
