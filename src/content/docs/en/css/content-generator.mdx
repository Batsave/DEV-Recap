These CSS properties allow you to add **automatically generated content** (text, symbols, images) before or after HTML elements.  
They are mainly used with the pseudo-elements `::before` and `::after`.

---

## Main properties

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `content` | Adds generated content into the document (text, icons, images). |
| `counter-increment` | Defines the increment step of a CSS counter. |
| `counter-reset` | Defines the initial value or resets a CSS counter. |
| `quotes` | Defines the characters used for quotation marks (opening/closing). |

## Simple example: adding content

```css
p::before {
  content: "→ ";
  color: gray;
}
```

Result: each paragraph will display an arrow before its text.

---

## Example with counters

```css
h2 {
  counter-increment: section; /* increments a counter for each h2 */
}

h2::before {
  content: "Section " counter(section) ": ";
}
```

Result:

- First h2 → "Section 1: ..."
- Second h2 → "Section 2: ..."



---

## Example with quotes

```css
q {
  quotes: "«" "»" "‹" "›";
}

q::before {
  content: open-quote;
}

q::after {
  content: close-quote;
}
```

Résult : a `<q>`element will automatically be displayed with French quotation marks (« ... »).

## Key takeaways

- `content` is used with `::before` and `::after` to insert generated content.  
- `counter-reset` initializes a counter, and `counter-increment` increases it.  
- `quotes` allows defining custom quotation marks.  
- These properties are useful for automatic numbering, adding icons, or customizing quotations.
