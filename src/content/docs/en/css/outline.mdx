While `border` properties define a border on the element itself,  
**`outline`** properties add a frame around the **content** of the element.  

Unlike `border`, `outline`:
- does not affect the size or position of the element,
- can extend outside the element’s box,
- is often used by browsers by default to indicate **keyboard focus**.

## Main properties

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `outline` | Shorthand property combining color, style, and width of the outline. |
| `outline-color` | Defines the outline color. |
| `outline-style` | Defines the outline style (`solid`, `dashed`, `dotted`, etc.). |
| `outline-width` | Defines the outline thickness. |

## Simple example

```css
button:focus {
  outline: 2px solid blue; /* Indicates keyboard focus */
}
input:focus {
  outline-color: red; /* Changes the outline color on focus */
}
```

## Accessibility and best practices

- `outline` is **fundamental for accessibility**: it allows users navigating with the keyboard (tab key) or people with low vision to see which element is active.  
- **Never remove** default outlines (`outline: none`) **without replacing them with a visible equivalent** (for example with `box-shadow`).  

### Correct example

```css
/* Bad: completely removes focus */
button:focus {
  outline: none;
}

/* Good: replaces it with a visible and accessible style */
button:focus {
  outline: none;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(0, 120, 255, 0.5);
}
```

## Key takeaways

- `outline` frames the content without affecting the element’s size.  
- Essential for indicating **keyboard focus** and ensuring accessibility.  
- Never remove `outline` without providing a **visible equivalent alternative**.  
- Use `outline` to improve **inclusive navigation** on your web pages.
