The following properties are only active when your visitors **print your web pages** or export them as **PDF** via the browser.  
They allow you to control display, page breaks, and formatting specific to the `print` media type.

---

## Main properties

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `marks` | Adds crop marks and alignment marks (professional printing). |
| `orphans` | Defines the minimum number of lines of a paragraph to show at the bottom of a page before a break. |
| `widows` | Defines the minimum number of lines of a paragraph to show at the top of a page after a break. |
| `page-break-before` | Forces a page break before the element. |
| `page-break-after` | Forces a page break after the element. |
| `page-break-inside` | Controls page breaks inside an element (`auto`, `avoid`). |
| `page` | Defines the page type or template to use. |
| `size` | Defines the size and/or orientation of the page (`A4`, `letter`, `landscape`, etc.). |

---

## Usage example

```css
@media print {
  /* Prevent splitting a table across pages */
  table {
    page-break-inside: avoid;
  }

  /* Force a page break before each heading */
  h1 {
    page-break-before: always;
  }

  /* Set page size to A4 in portrait orientation */
  @page {
    size: A4 portrait;
    margin: 2cm;
  }
}
```

## Why it matters today

- **PDF generation**: Many web applications offer PDF export (invoices, tickets, reports).  
  → These properties allow structuring the printed document properly.  
- **Accessibility and reading comfort**: Controlling orphans and widows (`orphans`, `widows`) prevents poorly split paragraphs and improves readability.  
- **Professional documents**: For reports, resumes, contracts, educational material… proper print rendering gives a more professional impression.  
- **Compliance with standard formats**: `@page` and `size` make it possible to produce content directly adapted to A4, Letter, etc., useful in an international context.  
- **Compatibility with modern browsers**: Chrome, Edge, Safari, and Firefox widely support these properties in their printing/PDF engines.

## Key takeaways

- Always include a `@media print` stylesheet if your site generates printable content.  
- Use `page-break-inside: avoid` for tables, images, and important sections.  
- Define `@page { size: A4; margin: ... }` to produce clean PDF output.  
- The `orphans` and `widows` properties provide better typographic control.  
- These tools are essential for any site that offers PDF export or high-quality printing.
