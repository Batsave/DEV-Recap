*"Ruby" are annotations meant to provide additional meaning or specify the pronunciation of a text segment.  
They are mainly used in Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean).*

---

## Standard properties (to use)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ruby-align` | Defines the alignment of ruby text relative to the base (e.g., `start`, `center`, `space-between`). |
| `ruby-position` | Defines the position of the ruby annotation (`over`, `under`, `inter-character`). Example: text above, below, or between characters. |

---

## Deprecated or non-standard properties

| Property | Status | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ruby-overhang` (sometimes written as `ruby-overhang.php` in old docs) | Deprecated, never standardized | Property specific to Internet Explorer/Opera for handling ruby text spacing. Not supported today. |

---

## Usage example

```html
<ruby>
  漢 <rt>kan</rt>
  字 <rt>ji</rt>
</ruby>
```

```css
ruby {
  ruby-align: center;
  ruby-position: over;
}
```

Result: the phonetic annotation (furigana) appears above the characters.

## Key takeaways

- The `ruby-align` and `ruby-position` properties are **standardized** and useful for Asian typography.  
- `ruby-overhang` was an experimental IE/Opera property, now **abandoned** and should not be used.  
- Ruby annotations improve **readability and linguistic accessibility**, especially for learning Japanese (furigana) and Chinese (pinyin).
