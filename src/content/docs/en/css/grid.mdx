## Grid layout (2D layout system)

`display: grid` transforms all direct children into cells of a two-dimensional grid.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
}
```
---

## Grid Template Columns & Rows

Define column and row tracks, often using functions like `repeat()` or `minmax()`.

<GridTemplate client:only="react"/>

---

## Auto-placement & Gap

`grid-auto-flow`, `grid-auto-columns/rows`, and `gap` handle automatic item placement and spacing.

<GridAutoPlacement client:only="react"/>

---

## Explicit placement: grid-column / grid-row / grid-area

Exact positioning of elements in the grid using line numbers or named areas.

<GridPlacement client:only="react"/>

---

## Alignment & Align-Self

Alignment rules in Grid come from the Flexbox module, now shared (box‑alignment).

<GridAlignSelf client:only="react"/>

---

## Responsive layout with Grid

Advanced examples: fluid layout from 1 to 3 columns, 12‑column system, product auto-placement.

<GridResponsive client:only="react"/>
